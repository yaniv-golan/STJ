**Date**: 2023-10-19

## Introduction

The **Standard Transcription JSON (STJ)** format is a proposed standard for representing transcribed audio and video data in a structured, machine-readable JSON format. It aims to provide a comprehensive and flexible framework that is a superset of existing transcription and subtitle formats.

## Getting Started

To get started with STJ, please refer to the [Getting Started Guide](./docs/getting-started.md).

## Installation

### Python Tools

Before running the Python tools, install the required packages. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

**Using a Virtual Environment:**

```bash
# Navigate to the tools/python/ directory
cd tools/python/

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Without a Virtual Environment:**

```bash
pip install -r tools/python/requirements.txt
```

### JavaScript Tools

Before running the JavaScript tools, install the required packages using `npm`.

```bash
# Navigate to the tools/javascript/ directory
cd tools/javascript/

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

For more detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting, please refer to the [Installation Guide](./docs/installation.md).

## Running Tests

### Python Tests

To run the Python tests:

```bash
cd tests/python/
python -m unittest discover
```

### JavaScript Tests

To run the JavaScript tests:

```bash
cd tools/javascript/
npm test
```

### Continuous Integration

The repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Tests are automatically run on every push and pull request.
